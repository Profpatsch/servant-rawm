This is the documentation-generation library for
[`servant-rawm`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-rawm).

See the `servant-rawm`
[`README.md`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-rawm) and
[Haddocks](side://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-rawm)
for a short explanation of how to use this package.

After `servant-rawm` 1.0.0.0, the implementations of the `RawM` endpoint are
divided into `servant-rawm-client`, `servant-rawm-docs`, and
`servant-rawm-server` to avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies and reduce
the compilation overhead.
